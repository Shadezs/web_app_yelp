# YELP
Overview
Platform: Web 

XXXX is built upon the Yelp API. XXXX will provide a list of restaurants based on best rating and affordability. It will display restaurants that are closest to your location. It will allow users to search for optimal restaurant choices, and filter based on type of food. It will also allow users to favorite their restaurants and use a randomizer to pick a restaurant when facing a dilemma to choose a restaurant.
 
                               


A typical user, Jenny, loves food but doesn’t want to break the bank. She would like options that get her good + affordable + convenient food. She also sometimes struggles with making a decision of which restaurant to visit. She then goes to XXX to see the restaurants that are closest to her. XXX will give her a list of restaurants that have good ratings and affordability, based on her location. She either decides to choose a restaurant from that list or she’s still struggling. If she is still struggling she navigates to her favorites list, clicks the randomizer, and XXXX chooses what restaurant she should visit!
